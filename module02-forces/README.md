# Forces

## Core Material

For each module, I will provide written and video tutorials on the topics. You can review whichever format suits you best. If the amount feels overwhelming, please reach out and we can help you narrow things down, and select a subset of the material to focus an exercise around. It's a lot!

## Supplemental Material

For each module, I will provide a list of additional video tutorials and readings that you may draw on for further exploration. It's unlikely you would be able to consume everything in one week and if you are looking for guidance about what might fit with your interests and learning style the most, please reach out.

## Assignment

Develop a sketch with motion driven by forces (vectors). Here are some ideas:

- Using forces, simulate a helium-filled balloon floating upward (and bouncing off the top of a window). Can you add a wind force which changes over time, perhaps according to Perlin noise?
- Create an example where instead of objects bouncing off the edge of the wall, an invisible force pushes back on the objects to keep them in the window. Can you weight the force according to how far the object is from an edge, i.e. the closer it is, the stronger the force?
- Create pockets of air resistance / friction in a p5 sketch. Try using circles instead of rectangles, i.e. pockets of mud (or ice). What if you vary the strength (drag / friction coefficient) of each circle? What if you make some of them the opposite of drag—i.e., when you enter a given pocket you actually speed up instead of slow down?
- Research a force not covered in class and implement it as a vector.
- Use the concept of forces to visualize some input (Could be data, literal example would be use wind data and translate to a wind force in p5 (see: [The Wind Map](http://hint.fm/wind/)), but feel free to think more abstractly.)
- Build a sketch that has both "Particles" and "Attractors". What if you make the Attractors invisible? Can you create a pattern / design from the trails of objects moving around attractors? This [p5.js coding challenge attraction video](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/56-attraction-and-repulsion-forces) and corresponding [attraction repulsion code example](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/full/6WL2O4vq0) offers starting point.
- The paper [“Classification of Symmetry Groups for Planar n-Body Choreographies” by James Montaldi and Katrina Steckles](https://doi.org/10.1017/fms.2013.5) explores <em>choreographic</em> solutions to the <em>n</em>-body problem (defined as periodic motions of bodies following one another at regular intervals). Educator and artist Dan Gries created [an interactive demonstration of these choreographies](https://dangries.com/rectangleworld/demos/nBody). Try adding a third (or more!) body to [Example 2.8: Two Body](https://editor.p5js.org/natureofcode/sketches/cmj37xPCM) and experiment with setting initial positions and velocities. What choreographies can you achieve?

### Instructions

- Document your work on the web with a short blog post. Here are some guiding questions if you are not sure what to write about:
  - What did you originally intend to create?
  - Narrate the process of creating your sketch.
  - What resources and examples did you draw on to create your sketch? What was most helpful / least helpful from this week’s materials.
  - What problems/discoveries did you encounter along the way?
- Submit a link to your blog post to the course wiki. - [ITP Section](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-syllabus-S25/wiki)
